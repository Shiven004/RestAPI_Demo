Assignment 
To be considered for the position, please build a small laboratory.  It should include
•	A REST API endpoint
•	Running POST or PUT to this endpoint runs an asynchronous task.
Once finished, compress your code into a zip file and send it to us.

Deliverable should include code for the above, Dockerfile and docker-compose.yml 
files which we will use to rebuild the laboratory on our end.  
We will be running and verifying the solution ourselves before 
agreeing to an interview for you to present the solution. 
We will have a few questions for you after you have presented this solution to us.
